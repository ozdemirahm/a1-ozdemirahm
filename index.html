   <h1>Introduction</h1>

    Camping considered a way of fun but long time ago people lived like that. To protect theirselfs and to fit harsh conditions these
    people found ways of living in the nature. Thanks to developing technology now people camping for just enjoy.
   </p>
   <p>People thinks that camping is time-consuming and tiring activity but it has also a lot fun and experience.
      In addition I dont agree with that it is tiring because many devices has produced to make camping much more easy.
   </p>
   <p>There is three important steps you need to follow in a good quality of camping.
   </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Plan</li>
  <li>Required Tools</li>
  <li>Seek Adventure</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
      <p>First,you need to make a plan for <strong> time,place and weather.</strong>

      </p>
  
      <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>You choose when you go to camp and how many days to stay there.
        </p>
        <h3>Place</h3>
        <p>You need to choose somewhere allowed to camping and the opportunity of this place's nearby should fit your plans.

        </p>
        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>It is about both time and place so you need to follow weather conditions in your camping area and make preparations according 
          to this weather events.

        </p>
        <h2>Required Tools</h2>
          <p>Every plan has its own required tools so there is also for camping. It is important because missing single apparatus may 
            turns your camping to nightmare.For example one day we broke the light we only have and after 8 p.m. we couldn't move easily 
            because of darkness.I write a list to you to give an idea.
          </p>

      <h2>Seek Adventure</h2>
      <p>The last thing I suggest you to enjoy your spending time in the camping.Join activities ,enjoy the view and connect with people
        not with phone.Spend time with your friends who enjoy to stand by.
